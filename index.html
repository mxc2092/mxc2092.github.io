						<h3>WHERE I'VE BEEN</h3>
						<p>I was born in Washington, DC and grew up in Potomac, Maryland.</p>
						<p>Growing up, I loved to take on any art project that came my way. From sketching to journaling to painting, I enjoyed any project where I could let my creativity shine through.</p>
						<p>In high school, I participated in my school's Arts and Humanities signature program. As a member of the program, I was surrounded with other students passionate about humanities and dove deeper into English and History curriculums. </p>
						<p>After taking an introductory to computer science course my freshman year, I discovered my interest in coding. I joined the Academy of Information Technology program at my high school and continued to take more coding classes. After taking numerous website development classes and diving into HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I realized that I could combine my interest in art with computer science for a career.</p>

						<h3>WHAT I'M DOING</h3>
						<p>I moved way down to coast to pursue an education at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.</p>
						<p>I am a member of the Communications Honors Program at the University of Miami where I am building my own academic path. I am one of 15 Sophomore students in the program. In addition to building my courses with my advisor, I complete specific honors section courses which dive deeper into the world of communications. My major is focused around website development and design, so I am taking coding, art, and communications classes. I am also double majoring in Computer Science and have a minor in Art.</p>
						<p>I work for the University of Miami Communications as a Web Developer. As a member of the Web team for UM Communications, I have worked on a variety of projects including redoing the School of Engineering sites, updating metadata for main school sites, and updating staff website profiles. It has been an excellent experience working with the team responsible for sites every student at the University of Miami visits daily.</p>

						<h3>WHAT I HOPE TO DO</h3>
						<p>As technology is evolving and becoming bigger and better, the workforce and needs of society are rapidly changing as well. So, I am open to different opportunities that come my way and feel that my academic path will prepare me well for many different work options.</p>
						<p>I hope to continue combining my interest in technology and art and am seeking a career in website development, graphic design, and computer science.</p>
						<p>I want to use my skills and creativity towards meaningful causes as well as inspire others to do what they love. </p>
						<p>I hope to immerse myself in different experiences as well as travel to learn more about different cultures. I have always loved the outdoors and living an active lifestyle so hope to continue to explore.</p>
						<p>I hope to continue completing outside projects that help me strengthen my skills and discover more about my interests.</p>
